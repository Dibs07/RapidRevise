This is under dashboard/[sessionId]/page.tsx in app router.... so take the sessionId and then fetch it in useeffect by api call...
I'll also pass a query parameter...if a query parameter is passed and that is ?new=true then simply that data will be fetched from the localstorage as it is done there....On the other hand is that query is not found then we will simply fetch the document by id from useeffect...

So it will e a bit dynamic....I know it's a big file...So don't give me the UI part....just give me core logical part that need to be changed
